      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>

A dedicated site would provide clear, accessible guides and tutorials to help new players understand and enjoy the game more quickly. Additionally, it could serve as a resource for existing players seeking to refine their skills and stay updated on the latest rules and strategies. Ultimately, the goal is to foster a welcoming and knowledgeable community for all Magic enthusiasts.</p>  <!-- change this -->
