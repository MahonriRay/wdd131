        <img src="images/magicCommander.jpeg" alt="Magic the Gathering Commander Format" loading="lazy">
        <p id="callAction">There are many Magic: The Gathering formats that can be played, Standard, Pauper, etc. One of the most popular formats is Commander, which I will explain how play on this page. 
        </p>
        <p>The Commander format of Magic: The Gathering, also known as EDH (Elder Dragon Highlander), is a popular multiplayer variant known for its unique deck-building rules and dynamic gameplay. 
            In this format, each player constructs a 100-card deck led by a legendary creature known as the "Commander," with no more than one copy of any card, except for basic lands. The format emphasizes strategic diversity and social interaction, making it a favorite among casual and competitive players alike. With its emphasis on creativity and personalized playstyles, Commander offers a rich and engaging experience that highlights the expansive possibilities within Magic: The Gathering.

            <h2 id="header">Anatomy of a Magic Card</h2>
            <div id="moreInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>A Magic: The Gathering card is composed of several key elements that convey its identity and functionality. At the top of the card is the name, 
                    followed by the mana cost, which indicates the resources required to play it. Below the name, on the left side, is the card type (such as creature, 
                    sorcery, or enchantment) and any relevant subtypes. 
                    The main artwork occupies a large central portion, visually representing the card's theme or character. Below the artwork is the text box, 
                    which contains the card's abilities, effects, and flavor text that adds thematic depth. Finally, at the bottom, you'll find the card's power
                     and toughness (for creatures), set symbol, collector number, and the artist's credit. These elements work together to provide all the necessary information for using the card in gameplay.</p>

            <h2 id="header">Untap Phase</h2>
            <div id="moreUntapInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>The Untap Phase is the first step in a player's turn in Magic: The Gathering. During this phase, 
                    the player untaps all their tapped cards, making them available for use again. This includes lands, 
                    creatures, artifacts, and any other permanents that were tapped during previous turns. The Untap Phase 
                    is crucial because it resets the player's resources, allowing them to use their lands for mana and their 
                    creatures for attacking or activating abilities in the upcoming phases of their turn. This phase happens 
                    automatically and does not allow any actions or responses from either player.</p>

            <h2 id="header">Upkeep Phase</h2>
            <div id="moreUpkeepInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>The Upkeep Phase is the second step in a player's turn in Magic: The Gathering, occurring immediately after 
                    the Untap Phase. During the Upkeep Phase, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep are put 
                    onto the stack and can be responded to by either player. This phase is often important for managing ongoing 
                    effects, such as paying cumulative upkeep costs or resolving certain triggered abilities. The Upkeep Phase 
                    sets the stage for the Draw Phase, ensuring that any necessary upkeep-related actions are addressed before 
                    the player draws a card.</p>

            <div id="morePcmInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>The Precombat Main Phase is a crucial step in a player's turn in Magic: The Gathering, occurring immediately 
                    after the Draw Phase and before the Combat Phase. During this phase, players can play lands, cast spells, and 
                    activate abilities. It's the primary opportunity for players to develop their board state by summoning creatures, 
                    setting up enchantments, and preparing for combat. Decisions made in this phase, such as which creatures to play 
                    or what spells to cast, can significantly influence the upcoming combat and the overall strategy for the turn. The 
                    Precombat Main Phase allows for a wide range of actions, making it a pivotal point for planning and executing game strategies.</p>

            <h2 id="header">Combat Phase</h2>
            <div id="moreCombatInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>The Combat Phase is a key part of a player's turn in Magic: The Gathering, where players can attack their opponents and engage 
                    in battles with their creatures. This phase is divided into five steps: Beginning of Combat, Declare Attackers, Declare Blockers, 
                    Combat Damage, and End of Combat. During the Declare Attackers step, the attacking player chooses which creatures will attack and 
                    who or what they will attack. In the Declare Blockers step, the defending player chooses which creatures, if any, will block the 
                    attackers. The Combat Damage step involves calculating and assigning damage from the attacking and blocking creatures. This phase 
                    is pivotal for applying pressure on opponents, reducing their life total, and managing board presence. Tactical decisions made 
                    during the Combat Phase can significantly influence the game's outcome.</p>

            <div id="morePostCombatInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>The Postcombat Main Phase follows the Combat Phase in Magic: The Gathering and serves as a second opportunity for players to cast 
                    spells, play lands, and activate abilities. Similar to the Precombat Main Phase, players can use this phase to further develop their 
                    board state, respond to changes that occurred during combat, or set up defenses for their opponent's turn. This phase allows for 
                    strategic adjustments based on the outcomes of combat, such as summoning new creatures, casting spells that might alter the game 
                    state, or playing an additional land if one hasn't been played yet this turn. The Postcombat Main Phase is essential for maximizing 
                    a player's tactical options and ensuring they are well-prepared for the next stages of the game.</p>

            <div id="moreEndInfo" style="display: none;">
                <p>The End Step, also known as the End Phase, is the final phase of a player's turn in Magic: The Gathering. During this phase, 
                    any abilities that trigger at the "beginning of the end step" are placed on the stack and resolved. This is the time for 
                    final actions and responses before the turn passes to the next player. The End Step allows players to cast instant spells 
                    and activate abilities one last time before the cleanup step, ensuring they can make final strategic moves or respond to 
                    their opponent's actions. It's a crucial moment for setting up defenses or executing plans that need to be in place before 
                    the opponent's turn begins.</p>
